The cryptographic paramters used by the secure channel are produced by the TLS Handshake protocol. 
The handshake protocol is used by the client and server when first communicating with each other.
The handshake protocol allows peers to negotiate a protocol version, select cryptographic algorithms, and optionally authenticate each other and establish shared secret keying material. 
Once the handshake is complete, the peers use the established keys to protect the application traffic. 

TLS Supports 3 basic key exchange mode:
1) (EC) DHE => Diffie - Hellman over either finite fields or elliptic curve
2) PSK only 
3) PSK with (EC)DHE
