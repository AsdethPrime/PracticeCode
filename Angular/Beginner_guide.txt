Removing AngularJS from your Search
---------------------------------------
You can easily exclude AngularJS search results form your search by using Google's search operators.
By appending -angularjs to your search term, you only get true angular results. This can be a huge lifesaver!

Installing angular
------------------
$ sudo -H npm install -g @angular/cli

Creating a new project [ called angular-project]
--------------------------------------------------
$ ng new angular-project

Flags of ng new
--directory => change name of project directory
--dry-run => print the changes it would have made to the console
--routing => Generates an additional module to contain the angular routing definitions. This is turned off by default.
--skip-commit => The angular-cli does not only initialize a Git repository for your project by default but also issues a commit after file generation is done. Use this option to turn that off.
--skip-git => Turns off the automatic Git repository initialization for your project. 
--skip-install => After creating all files, the angular-cli runs an npm install command, to download and install all required dependencies. Because this process can take a while, it can be very useful to turn that behavior off. 
--skip-tests => Per default, the cli generates test files for each component (.spec files). With this option, you can turn that off.
--source-dir => The cli generates all source files inside of an "src" directory. With this flag, you can change the directory for your source files.
--style => The angular-cli leaves it up to you, whether you want to use a css pre-compiler. It generates plain css files per default. With this option you can change that. Possible values are css, scss, less, sass, styl (stylus).
--verbose => Enables advanced detail logging.
