Removing AngularJS from your Search
---------------------------------------
You can easily exclude AngularJS search results form your search by using Google's search operators.
By appending -angularjs to your search term, you only get true angular results. This can be a huge lifesaver!

Installing angular
------------------
$ sudo -H npm install -g @angular/cli

Creating a new project [ called angular-project]
--------------------------------------------------
$ ng new angular-project
