To use a http server a cliane must:
const http = require('http');

HTTP message headers are represented in a JSON style key-value pair object
{
'content-lenght': 123,
'content-type': 'text/plain',
'connection': 'keep-alive',
'host' : 'mysite.com',
'accept': '*/*'
}

Node.js HTTP API is very low level. It deals with stream handling and message parsing only. It parses a message into headers and body but it does not parse the actual headers or the body. 

The raw headers as they are received are retained in rawHeaders property, which is an array containing multple key-value pairs.
