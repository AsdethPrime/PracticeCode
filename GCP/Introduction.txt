Different products are charged differently.
With persistent disk you pay for the capacility you allocate whereas with cloud storage buckets you pay for capacity you actually use
All billable resources are grouped into an entity called projects

Regiones are geographical regions at the level of a subcontinent - for example: the central us, east Asia etc. 
Zones are a colection of data-centers within the region

If you replicate resources across different zones, such architecture can legitimately termed as "high availability architecture"

If a resource is available globally, it is known as a global or a multiregional resource. 
These multiregional resources tend to be the most expensive, the most available and most widely replicated.
One step down comes regional resources these only need to be replicated within different data centers with the region. 

Below these are zonal resources which only need to be replicated within the same data center. 


Storage technologies tend to be regional or global
Cloud SQL -> regional 
Big Table -> regional 
Cloud Spanner -> global

Compute tends to be regional or zonal 
1) AppEngine -> Regional 
2) VM -> Zonal 
3) Disk Storage -> Zonal
