Everyone is talking about yarn but I have always used npm. Lets take this for a spin and see what advantage I get.
// Making a sample project director and jumping into it
$ mkdir ~/Desktop/yarn
$ cd ~./Desktop/yarn

// Starting a new project
$ yarn init
=> Walks me through the creation of package.json with the following questions:
# name
# version
# description
# entry point
# repository url
# author
# licence
# private 
=> Once completed creates me a simple package.json file:
{
  "name": "testing_yarn",
  "version": "1.0.0"
   "description": "Trying to take yarn out for a spin",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "Asdethprime",
  "license": "MIT"
}
