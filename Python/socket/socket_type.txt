Background on socket types 
---------------------------

Unix sockets
=> Name AF_UNIX [ Address Family Unix] or AF_LOCAL [ Address Family Local ]
=> Used for communication between processes on the same host 
=> As of 2001 AF_UNIX is meant to be replaced by AF_LOCAL but they are both present in most programming interface for backward compatibiltiy 
=> Unix/Local sockets are filesystem based 

Internet socket 
=> AF_INET and AF_INET6
=> Network based sockets 

AF_NETLINK is a special type of Linux socket created to allow communication between user and kernel level code using the standard BSD socket interface. 

AF_TIPC is linux support for Transparent Interprocess Communication [ TIPC ]. TIPC allow cluster of computers to talk to each other without using IP based addressing.
