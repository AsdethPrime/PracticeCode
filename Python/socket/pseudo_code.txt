Creating a TCP Server Socket
----------------------------
# create the socket
ss = socket.socket()

# bind socket to hostname and post
ss.bind()

# listen for connection 
ss.listen()

# Accept client connection 
client_connection = ss.accept()

# Receive data from client
client_connection.recV()

# Send data to client
client_connection.send()

#Close communication with client
client_connection.close()

# close the server socket
ss.close()
