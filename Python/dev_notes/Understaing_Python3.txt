=> On ubuntu laptoo python3 interpreter is located in /usr/bin/python3
=> comes with its own man and info page; has lots of option to explore in future
=> typing python3 on terminal takes you directly to python terminal 
=> Sample Code:
    import sys
    sys.path 
=> This will show the default path used by system 
=> On my ubuntu they are on :
  1. "" // local directory
  2. /usr/lib/python36.zip
  3. /usr/lib/python3.6
  4. /usr/lib/python3.6/lib-dynload
  5. /home/manish/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages
  6. /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages
  7. /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
