Hi Team,

It appears that Ausgrid has updated the ticket system on their end and we are receiving one ticket for an new order and one ticket to add to MDM or to at least check the User exist on the MDM.

Any tickets with “[##] SCTASK” should already have an existing order simply add the User is they don’t already exist and resolve the ticket out advising of the work completed.
