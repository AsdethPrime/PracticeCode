Hi Anthony,

Thanks for sharing these details. I want to add that MDM cannot set the default application hence the 9 or 10 devices which have the Secure Launcher profile on them, can be assisted to set the default application on the device following the below steps. 

1.      Access the Settings
2.      Go to Application manager 
3.      Tap on the application and review the “Set as Default” option 
4.      Clear Defaults
5.      Open the PDF with the correct application when prompted. 

I can request Service desk to guide the users to perform above steps to resolve the issue.
