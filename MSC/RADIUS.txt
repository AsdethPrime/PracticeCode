If a QAS or a QPS officer calls regarding issues accessing cellular network [ i.e. my internet is not working] one of the following has gone wrong:
1) The sim card has incorrect settings => You can check and change this back to correct settings by calling Vita group and providing them the asset number that the officer is using. 
2) Device currently has incorrect settings
=> Check if the device is enrolled [ QPS is DEP so it's not going to be a problem for them, QAS that are not DEP enrolled might have this issue ]
=> Check if the device is getting correct APN profile from MDM 
=> Check that the device is pointing to the correct APN 
### Remember, if nothing else works , these are DEP device. As long as you can ensure the officer's username is associated to all the correct security group [ can be done from VITA ] as well as have the correct Organizational Group [ honestly you can practically forget about Organizational Group for QAS and QPS because if they are on wrong OG group, your only work around that is a hotswap] 
3) Device is not physically faulty
=> Goes without saying either sim is faulty or device itself is fault. 
=> Solution as always - hotswap
4) Last and hopefully the least - service number is missing from RADIUS server
