Packet Data Protocol (PDP) 

Things we tried but did not work
--------------------------------

PDP Authentication Error Troubleshooting
-----------------------------------------
-> Make sure the device is enrolled and checking in 
-> Make sure if has the correct APN code 
-> Make sure QAS DEP APN profile has been applied
-> check with vita to make sure telstra.internet and telstra.wap codes have been applied 
-> First time tried username and password of the officer to see if that works - did not work
-> Tried full email address and password to see if that makes a difference 
-> got him to disconnect 

But even then no solution
