Hi Amrinder, 

You had asked me to conduct research on Caltex store iPAD and their support structure. This is what I have found:
1)	Their first point of contact is Bamboora Service Desk
2)	Order comes to us through email for new iPAD
3)	For every store, 2 iPAD are ordered
4)	These iPAD are DEP enabled but staged from our
5)	From our end for a new device order:
a.	We get an email request with order form
b.	We put this through to fleet for staging
c.	This then gets sent to Caltex store
d.	Once received we close the ticket
6)	For incident:
a.	Calls are logged through Bamboora Service Desk
b.	We create an INC ticket 
c.	Try to troubleshoot this; if resolved we resolve the ticket
d.	If a replacement is required – we warm transfer the user to Bambora Service Desk and resolved our ticket

We also appear to have wifi password and Caltex account details on our end:
-	WiFi name is Network Penguine
-	Wifi password is Pizza4d!nner
-	Store iPAD are set up under 2 usernames:
o	CaltexStoreProd (Production) 
o	CaltexStoreUAT (test) – normally not used 
-	Account is a basic account ( 105 in total enrolled)
