// Unlocking SIM PIN
Settings > Cellular Data > Cellular Data Options > sim Pin ( normally down the bottom) > Change > type old sim pin > Retype old sim pin and that unlocks it 


// QAS Apple ID
=> for apple ID use their work email
=> they wont have the password - for that iforgot.apple.com


// Sim and Passcode lock 
For qps it is a hotswap right away because we canâ€™t take the SIM card out but for qas we can so if you insert a unlocked SIM card into the device you can then send the clear passcode command which will avoid hotswap.
