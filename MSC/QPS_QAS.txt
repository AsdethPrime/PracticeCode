// Unlocking SIM PIN
Settings > Cellular Data > Cellular Data Options > sim Pin ( normally down the bottom) > Change > type old sim pin > Retype old sim pin and that unlocks it 


// QAS Apple ID

=> they wont have the password - for that iforgot.apple.com


// Sim and Passcode lock 
For qps it is a hotswap right away because we can’t take the SIM card out but for qas we can so if you insert a unlocked SIM card into the device you can then send the clear passcode command which will avoid hotswap.

Description :received from: yekshah.chetty@ambulance.qld.gov.au

Hi Zoe,

In the past I have not been asked to approve hot swaps.

Approval has only been required for lost/stolen devices as this is not a ‘hot swap’ and the allocated device will be reducing the ‘hot swap’ pool.

Approval is also required for the replacement of cases. If replacement chargers are required these need to be referred to the callers Manager to organise locally.

Vita send me an approval request should the device be deemed repairable.

Cheers,

Yekshah
