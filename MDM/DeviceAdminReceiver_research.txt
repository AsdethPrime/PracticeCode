To create my Android MDM agent I would need to have the app registered as device administrator.

The following steps are required to do so:

a) Crate a sub-class of DeviceAdminReceiver
b) Register device admin in manifest.xml
c) Declare the security policies in device_policies.xml
d) Createa a class PolicyManager.java
e) Enable the admin

Step 1: Create a sub-class of DeviceAdminReceiver

public class MyDeviceAdminReceiver extends DeviceAdminReceiver
{
  @Override
  public void onEnabled(Context context, Intent intent)
    {
      super.onEnabled(context,intent);
    }
 }
