I created this file so I can keep track of the big picture.
As i am a single developer, attempting to create a whole system you can expect a lot of change to the orginal draft.
The plan at the moment is to create an open source version of Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM)
The whole system requires the following components to run:
a. An Agent Program running on the device 
b. A Command and Control Server that listen to incoming connection and that provides commands for the Agent application to Execute
c. Police Engine. A seperate program that runs on the Command and Control Server.
d. Proxy Server : A proxy server that stand between mobile device and corporate network which control access based on device posture.
