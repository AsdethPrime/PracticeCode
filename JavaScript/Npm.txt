NPM [ Node Package Manager ]
----------------------------
=> Consists of 3 different components:
1) The website [ www.npmjs.com]
2) Command line interface 
3) The registry

=> npm website is used to discover packages and set up profiles.
=> cli runs on terminal allowing developers to interact with npm. 
=> registry is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta info surrounding it. 
=> install the latest version of npm on command line 
$ cd ~
$ sudo npm install npm@latest -g
=> A package is a file or a directory that is described by a package.json file. 
=> A package must have a package.json file in order to be published to npm registry.
=> Packages can be scoped and unscoped. Scoped packages can in turn be private or public.
=> A module is any file or directory that is located inside node_modules directory and that can be loaded by require() function [ require() function from nodejs ]
=> To be loaded by node.js require function , a module must be one of the following:
1) a folder with a package.json file containing a main field
2) a folder with a index.js file in it
3) a JavaScript file 
=> Since modules are not required to have a package.json file, not all modules are packages but all packages are modules. 
=> In the context of a node program the module is also the thing that gets loaded from a file
  var req = require('request') ;
  That above code can be interpreted as " variable req refers to the request module "
