=> main: The main field is a module ID that is the primary entry point to your program. For example: if your package is named foo, and a user installs it , and then calls require("foo") your main modules export objects will be returned. 

=> bin: A lot of packages have one or more executable files that they would like to install into the $PATH. To use this feature supply a bin field in your package.json which is a map of a command name to a local file.

=> You may specify a tarball URL in place of a version range. This tarball will be downloaded into your package at install time. 

=> devDependencies: If someone is planning on downloading and using your module in their project, they probably don;t want to download and build the external test or documentation framework that you use.
