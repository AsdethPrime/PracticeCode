There are 4 different types of app components:
1. Activities
2. Service
3. Broadcast Receiver
4. Content Provider

An Activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with user interface.

You implement an Activity as a subclass of Active Class [ 	android.app.Activity ]

A service is a general purpose entery point for keeping an app running on the background. A service does not provide a user interface. Another component, such as an Activity, can start a service and let it run or bind to it in order to interact with it.

A started service tells the system to keep them running until their work is complete. 
A bound service runs because some other app has said it wants to make use of the service. 
A Service is implemented as a subclass of Service Class [ andoid.app.Service ]
